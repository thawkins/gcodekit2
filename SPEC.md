## Session Summary (October 19, 2025 - 3D Visualizer Controls Enhancement)

### 3D Visualizer Camera Controls Improvements

Implemented enhanced 3D visualizer camera controls with better responsiveness and mouse scroll support:

#### Features Added:
- **Improved Slider Responsiveness**: Added `drag_value_speed()` to all camera sliders (pitch, yaw, zoom) for smoother, more responsive drag interactions
- **Mouse Scroll Zoom**: When the 3D visualizer window has focus, users can now scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in/out (scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out)
- **Value Persistence**: Camera control values now properly persist when the user releases the controls (drag_value_speed ensures values stick)
- **Zoom Bounds**: Zoom constrained to 0.1x-5.0x range for stable visualization
- **Drag Sensing**: Enhanced interaction sensing with `click_and_drag` for better responsiveness to user input

#### Implementation Details:
- **Location**: `src/ui/tabs/visualizer_3d.rs` lines 42-170
- **Pitch Control**: Range -90° to +90°, step 5°, drag speed 0.5°
- **Yaw Control**: Range 0° to 360°, step 5°, drag speed 0.5°
- **Zoom Control**: Range 0.1x to 5.0x, step 0.1x, drag speed 0.01x
- **Mouse Scroll**: Uses `raw_scroll_delta.y` for precise scroll tracking
- **Interaction Sense**: Changed from `click()` to `click_and_drag()` for improved responsiveness

#### Testing:
- All 372+ tests passing (100%)
- Debug build successful
- No compilation warnings in project code

#### Status:
✅ COMPLETED - Camera controls now respond smoothly to user input and values persist correctly when released
